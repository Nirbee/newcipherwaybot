"""PanelSyncService — mirror Remnawave nodes/squads into local tables.

Called by the cabinet's «Синхронизировать» button and by the periodic scheduler job.
Upserts by panel uuid. A node that vanished from the panel is DELETED — but only on a
healthy sync (the panel returned a non-empty list), so an API hiccup returning nothing
never wipes every node. This removes nodes the owner deleted on the panel, and the stale
duplicate you'd otherwise see when a node is re-created with a new uuid.
