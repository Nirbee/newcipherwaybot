"""RemnawaveResyncService — nightly self-healing sweep of bot <-> panel drift.

For every locally-active subscription we fetch its panel user and reconcile:
  * panel user vanished        -> local sub DISABLED (someone deleted it in the panel)
  * panel disabled / expired   -> re-apply our authoritative spec (what the customer
    actually paid for), panel-first — corrects manual panel edits
  * expiry drifted > 1 day     -> same re-apply

We are the source of truth for what was PAID; the panel is only a projection. This
keeps subscribers working after admins poke the panel by hand.
